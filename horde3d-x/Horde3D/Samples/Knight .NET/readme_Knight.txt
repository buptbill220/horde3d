This sample shows a knight model and enables you to blend freely between
two different movements. The knight has a particle system attached to the
tip of his sword which results in some interesting graphical effects.
A simple radial blur post processing effect is applied to the scene to
demonstrate the flexible rendering pipeline.


Input:

	Use WASD to move and the mouse to look around.
	Use 1 and 2 to blend between character animations.
	Space freezes the scene.
	F1 toggles fullscreen mode.
	F7 toggles debug view.
	F9 toggles FPS and information display.
	ESC quits the application.
